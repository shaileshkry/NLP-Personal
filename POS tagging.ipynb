      " 22:01 Local Time, 16:31 GMT, 22:01 IST: So India seal the game with overs to go. Despite losing skipper Rohit Sharma for a duck, the hosts never broke a sweat in this chase. Kohli played overly aggressive, playing a few proper slogs as he scored a brisk 29 before falling to Naveen-ul-Haq. Jaiswal on the other end though stayed busy throughout his innings, always looking for the aggressive option. He attacked Mujeeb and Noor Ahmad, getting to a 27-ball fifty. At the other end was the spin basher Shivam Dube who took down an experienced campaigner like Nabi for three consecutive sixes, and then there was no turning back. Another impressive knock from the southpaw, as he notched up a 22-ball fifty and stayed till the end to help his team cross the line. Karim Janat came on and stalled the end by picking two in his first over, but the result was never in doubt. India take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series, stay around for the presentations.\n",
      " Fazalhaq Farooqi to Shivam Dube, leg byes, 1 run, a leg bye to win it!! Full and sliding onto the pads, deflects behind square and the Indians will cross over. An easy win and they claim the series as well. \n",
